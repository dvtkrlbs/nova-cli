# msp

msp is a library for communicating with
the flight controllers that speak MSP. It is mainly developed for creating
companion computers (such as RPI).

It's regularly tested with both [iNAV](https://github.com/inavFlight/inav) but should work
with any other MSP based firmware.

This project was forked from **Alberto**'s [msp-tool](https://github.com/fiam/msp-tool).
